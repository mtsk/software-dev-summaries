Steve Krug: Don't Make Me Think

---

> *Core message: good design minimizes thinking.*

> *A usable interface is one that explains itself.*

> *Design should reduce cognitive load, follow conventions, and allow users to accomplish their goals quickly and effortlessly—without stopping to think.*

> *Great UIs succeed when they rely on recognition, conventions, and clarity—not explanation.*

## Core Ideas & Principles
**Users don’t read — they scan**
→ People skim pages for keywords, headings, and cues. Design should support fast scanning, not careful reading.

**Don’t make users think**
→ Interfaces should be self-explanatory. If users have to stop and figure things out, the design has failed.

**Clear visual hierarchy matters**
→ Size, color, spacing, and placement should instantly communicate what’s important and what’s related.

**Obvious navigation beats clever navigation**
→ Labels, menus, and links should be predictable and familiar. Cleverness creates confusion.

**Eliminate unnecessary choices**
→ Too many options slow users down. Fewer, clearer choices lead to better decisions.

**Conventions are your friends**
→ Using established patterns (logos linking to home, underlined links, shopping cart icons) reduces learning effort.

**Words matter**
→ Short, clear, and meaningful text helps users understand what actions do and what content means.

**Users will muddle through—but that’s not success**
→ Just because users *can* use something doesn’t mean it’s usable. Struggle is still failure.

**Usability testing doesn’t have to be expensive**
→ Testing with just a few users, early and often, reveals most usability problems.

**Fix the biggest problems first**
→ Address major usability blockers before polishing minor details.

## Rules of thumb:
* If users have to think, the design is broken.
* Design for scanning, not reading.
* Make the important things look important.
* Use familiar patterns; don’t reinvent conventions.
* Clarity beats cleverness every time.
* Reduce choices to speed decisions.
* Navigation should answer “Where am I? Where can I go?” instantly.
* Labels should clearly describe what users will get, not be witty.
* Every extra word or element increases cognitive load.
* Users will struggle through bad design—don’t mistake that for usability.
* Test early, test often, test cheaply.
* Fix big usability problems before polishing details.
* Assume users are busy, impatient, and distracted.
* If something is important, repeat it visually and verbally.
* The best interface explains itself without instructions.

## Principles with real-world UI examples

### 1. *Don’t make users think*
**Principle:** The purpose of every screen should be instantly obvious.  
**Example:** **Google Search homepage** — a single input field and a button. No explanation needed.

### 2. *Users scan, they don’t read*
**Principle:** Design for skimming with clear headings and visual cues.  
**Example:** **Amazon product pages** — bold titles, bullet-point features, price emphasized, reviews highlighted.

### 3. *Clear visual hierarchy*
**Principle:** Important things look important.  
**Example:** **Stripe dashboard** — primary metrics are large and prominent; secondary actions are visually subdued.

### 4. *Obvious navigation over clever navigation*
**Principle:** Familiar labels beat creative ones.  
**Example:** **Wikipedia** — plain navigation like “Contents,” “Edit,” and “References” instead of branded terms.

### 5. *Eliminate unnecessary choices*
**Principle:** Fewer choices = faster decisions.  
**Example:** **iOS permission dialogs** — usually just “Allow” or “Don’t Allow,” no extra options.

### 6. *Conventions are your friends*
**Principle:** Follow established UI patterns.  
**Example:** **Logo links to homepage** across nearly all e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon, Etsy).

### 7. *Make clickable elements obvious*
**Principle:** Users shouldn’t guess what is interactive.  
**Example:** **LinkedIn buttons** — high contrast, clear labels like “Connect” or “Apply.”

### 8. *Words matter*
**Principle:** Labels should describe exactly what happens.  
**Example:** **Gmail’s “Archive” vs “Delete”** — distinct actions clearly labeled to avoid mistakes.

### 9. *Reduce noise, increase signal*
**Principle:** Remove anything that doesn’t support the user’s goal.  
**Example:** **Medium article pages** — minimal UI, content-first layout, distractions hidden.

### 10. *Users will muddle through*
**Principle:** Just because users succeed doesn’t mean it’s usable.  
**Example:** **Legacy enterprise software forms** — users complete tasks only after training or trial-and-error.

### 11. *Error prevention beats error messages*
**Principle:** Design so mistakes are hard to make.  
**Example:** **Password strength indicators** — real-time feedback before form submission.

### 12. *Usability testing doesn’t need to be fancy*
**Principle:** A few users can uncover most problems.  
**Example:** **Early-stage startups** watching 3–5 users attempt signup and checkout flows.

### 13. *Fix the biggest problems first*
**Principle:** Address blockers before polish.  
**Example:** **Checkout redesigns** that simplify payment flow before changing colors or fonts.
